# Create a Twitter Developer Account

## Introduction

This workshop makes extensive use of Twitter's [Filtered Steam API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction) for retrieving public tweets in near real-time. In order to use this API, we need to have access to a Twitter developer account.

### Objectives

1. Create and/or login to a Twitter user account.
2. Create and/or login to a Twitter developer account.
3. Create a Twitter App and generate access keys.

### Prerequisites

You will have to create both a Twitter user account (in case you do not have one already) and a Twitter developer account (again, assuming you do not have one). The creation and usage of these accounts are governed by the following terms of service agreements:

1. [Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos)
2. [Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)

Please make sure you are able to abide by the terms and conditions mentioned in these agreements.

## Task 1: Create and/or login to your Twitter user account

In the first step, we will need to make sure you have a valid Twitter user account. If you do already have a functioning Twitter account (one that you can login to), please skip to the next task.

Please follow the Twitter sign-up process [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup).

## Task 2: Create and/or login to your Twitter developer account

1. After you have created your Twitter user account and successfully logged-in to Twitter using this account, please follow the instructions [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).

2. You will need to validate your email account to complete the registration process.

## Task 3: Creating a Twitter app

1. After verifying your email account, you will be asked to name your first app. This value can be changed later so choose a name that will work for now. The app name must be unique.
2. You will be presented with a set of keys:
   * API Key
   * API Key Secret
   * Bearer Token

   **Please save these keys in a safe place as we will need them later**.  
   The Bearer token will be used in this demo to authenticate with the Twitter API.
3. After your have copied and saved your keys in a safe place, you can proceed to the Developer Portal Dashboard where you will see summary information for your Developer Account.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
