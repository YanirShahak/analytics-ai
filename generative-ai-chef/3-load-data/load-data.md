## Introduction

To proceed with the lab we would need to load the recipe dataset that will be used for the large language model tuning. A good dataset is crucial for tuning a large language model on a specific task because it provides the necessary training signal, represents the task accurately, avoids bias, incorporates domain-specific knowledge, and enables effective evaluation and iterative improvements. It ensures the model's ability to generalize, perform well on diverse inputs, and produce accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

Estimated time - 5 minutes

### Objectives

1. Download the dataset
2. Upload the dataset into your notebook
3. Run your first dataset preparation code

### Prerequisites

By now you should have your OCI Data Science Notebook up and running and ready for use.

## Task 1: Download dataset

## Task 2: Upload the dataset

## Task 3: Create and run a dataset prep notebook

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
